# knight_moves

This project has been created during the odin project.
First implementation was first creating the tree then traversing it in width.
This solution was very slow.
I implemented an improved solution with creation of the nodes level by level with comparison with the stop point at the same time.

This code has been implemented without TDD, there are integrations tests at the end confirming that everything is running ok.
A potential improvement would be to increase the test coverage of the code by unit testing.
